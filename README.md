# H-M-Email-Marketing-A-B-Testing-Project
This project involves running an A/B test to enhance the open rates of H&amp;M's marketing emails. Currently, the open rate stands at 18%, and the goal is to increase this to at least 20%. We will compare the effectiveness of two different email subject lines using Excel to manage and analyze the data.
